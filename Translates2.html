The rivers that fertilized the soil allowed the Assyrians and Chaldeans to engage in agriculture. They were the first to use the wheel and then the first plows were used. The very ancient drawings found in the form of cave paintings and engravings testify that the plow was one of the first tools used by sedentary man. by sedentary man. The plows handled by man took the name of mancera plow, which was so called, because it took the name of the plowtail it had, which was the curved piece where the plow was wielded. The plows were first made of wood or were formed by a branch of suitable shape and human traction. Sometimes they were made with branches in the form of a fork; they were pulled by an animal or a person to open the furrow of the land. About 3,000
                        years B.C. C. they began to use oxen to pull them. The Romans introduced the plow with an iron blade pulled by oxen. In the Middle Ages, ploughshares and blades began to be used on the hardest soils in Europe. The Rotherham plow was built in England in 1730 and its triangular shape made it easier to pull and better suited to be pulled by horses. It was built by the Dutchman Joseph Foljambe and marks the beginning of its industrial manufacture. The first plow built entirely of iron was made by the Englishman Robert Ransome in 1808. In France, in 1825, a blacksmith from Aisne, surnamed Fonduer, built the first metal plow with a front set. In the 1830s (some say 1837 to be more precise), the American blacksmith John Deere invented the steel plowshare. This was followed by the invention of the two-wheel plow with a driver's seat, and later by the disc plow, which appeared in 1847 in the United States; and another that was received with great success in Australia in 1877, constructed
                        by John Shearer and Sons. And then, with the advent of the tractor, first steam, then gasoline, and today with the
                        gasoline-powered, and today with the most up-to-date technologies, agricultural tasks have been greatly facilitated.
